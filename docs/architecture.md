# AI E-Commerce Manager - System Architecture

## 1. Overall Architecture

### Microservices Architecture
The application follows a microservices architecture, separating core functionalities into distinct services:

- **E-commerce Service**: Handles Shopify, WooCommerce, and other e-commerce platform integrations
- **Affiliate Marketing Service**: Manages connections with affiliate networks like Amazon Associates, ShareASale
- **Dropshipping Service**: Integrates with dropshipping platforms (Oberlo, AliExpress)
